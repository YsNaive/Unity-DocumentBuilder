This package supplies a simple way to build up documention.
Programs can write annotations, but obviously not all situations are applicable. Sometimes you need to design the behavior of monsters, the design pattern of specific objects, and even complex program relationship calls. At this time, what you need is DocumentBuilder.

DocumentBuilder can directly write documents in UnityEditor, without the need for other websites or software, and use the custom window to display. It is very suitable for writing meeting points, design, program API, custom inspector, etc.

- Easy to edit
