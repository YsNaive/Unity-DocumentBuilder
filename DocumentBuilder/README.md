# What's New in 2.0?

The previous DocumentBuilder was designed exclusively for the Editor. However, in version 2.0, everything has been transformed into VisualElement, resulting in improved readability, expandability, and adaptability. Additionally, you can now utilize your docs at Runtime as well. However, please note that version 2.0 is not compatible with the older 1.x version. If you have a specific requirement for the older version, you can download it from the GitHub page.

In version 2.0, you have the flexibility to add your own DocType, and the system will automatically detect it. This allows you to customize all the contents you want to display. For example, you can implement an item system in your project or create a clock display with your desired specifications. The new version empowers you to tailor the documentation to your specific needs and requirements, enhancing the overall user experience.


Animation is a significant improvement in DocumentBuilder. Once you define the animation behavior, you can easily call it using a simple API interface. The built-in components also come with default Intro and Outtro animations, making it easy to add dynamic and engaging visual effects to your documents.
